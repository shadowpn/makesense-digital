Capstone Project – OnlineCourseFlow
Project Overview
CourseFlow is a modern online learning platform that allows users to browse, save, and take interactive courses. Registered users gain access to a curated catalog of course cards and can save courses to their personal dashboard. Each course includes a detailed description, video lessons, and a comment section where learners can ask questions or leave feedback.

The platform includes a full admin panel for uploading and managing courses, and is built using Django on the backend and Next.js + Tailwind CSS on the frontend. The application is fully responsive and optimized for mobile use.
Distinctiveness and Complexity
This project is fundamentally distinct from previous CS50W assignments in the following ways:

Not a social network
While comments exist, the core focus is on content consumption and course engagement—not on user-to-user interactions or activity feeds.

Not an e-commerce app
There is no shopping cart, payment gateway, or checkout flow. “Enrollment” is purely access control without handling financial transactions.

Purpose-built for education
Inspired by platforms like Coursera and Udemy, this application delivers video lessons, structured course management, and a Q&A thread—features beyond the scope of any CS50W sample project.

Technical Complexity Highlights
Authentication System
Full JWT-based login and registration via Django REST Framework, with tokens stored in localStorage and managed by a custom authHelpers.js utility on the frontend.

Protected Routes & Redirects
Client-side guards using Next.js’ useRouter.replace ensure only authenticated users access /protected/*; missing or expired tokens trigger immediate redirects to /auth.

Admin-Managed Course CRUD
Through Django’s admin interface, site administrators can create, update, and delete courses—including uploading videos, images, and rich descriptions—without writing any JavaScript.

Personal Dashboard
Enrolled courses persist on both the server and in localStorage. A paginated dashboard lets users revisit or unenroll from any saved course with a single click.

Course Detail Page
Each course has its own /protected/courses/[slug] page featuring an HTML5 video player, rich text description, and a live comment thread for Q&A.

Comment System
Learners can post and view comments via DRF endpoints, with the frontend polling for new replies without full page reloads.

Reusable Pagination Component
A single Pagination component handles any paginated list (Store, Dashboard). It supports previous/next buttons, ellipses (…) for large ranges, and updates the ?page= query parameter dynamically.

Rich Text Description Formatting
Course descriptions may include multiple paragraphs, line breaks, and lists. We preserve this formatting on the frontend via a FormattedText component that wraps raw textarea input in:

<div class="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">…original text…</div>
Mobile-First, Responsive Design A custom useIsMobile hook plus Tailwind’s responsive utilities ensure every page and component adapts cleanly from 320 px to desktop breakpoints.

Modern UI & Animations Neumorphic buttons, gradient-wave CSS animations (@keyframes), soft shadows, and consistent card layouts deliver a polished, engaging user experience.

How to Run
Install dependencies 1.1 Backend: cd capstone/backend pip install -r requirements.txt
1.2 Frontend: cd capstone/front npm install

Set up database cd capstone/backend python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate

Create superuser (for admin access)

python manage.py createsuperuser

Run servers
Backend (Django):

cd capstone/backend python manage.py runserver

Frontend (Next.js):

cd capstone/front npm run dev

App will be running at: http://localhost:3000 (Frontend) http://localhost:8000 (Backend API)

Additional Notes

Only registered users can access course content. All API calls use secure JWT authorization.

Admins can upload new courses including video lessons and manage them via /admin/.

Token refresh is handled automatically through custom authHelpers.js.

Sample .env.local: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

Backend works with sqlite3 DB and It is easily portable to any relational database like PostgreSQL

The application is a fully integrated SPA with real-time data fetching and route protection.
